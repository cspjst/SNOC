# SNOC
Implementing the StriNg Oriented symBOlic Language patterns in C.

Importing the practical discrete recognition systems from SNOBOL4 into C for powerful string handling and parsing whilst maintaing C idioms. 

SNOBOL4 patterns are more powerful than regular expressions (Chomsky Type-3) and can express context-free grammars (Chomsky Type-2).
